# DonaSol
Decentralized Donation Platform on Solana

**Project Overview**
  * Capstone Project Name/Idea: Decentralized Donation Platform (DonaSol)
  * Brief Project Description: This project aims to create a decentralized donation platform on the Solana blockchain, where entities can subscribe and request donations, which are approved by the platform administrator, and users can donate SOL and receive core NFTs. A reward system would also be implemented to motivate donations and participation (with points updated with each donation).
  * Reason for Choosing this Project: The motivation behind this project is to create a transparent and efficient donation system, while implementing and consolidating new concepts of blockchain and build up skills for developing in the Solana ecosystem. The platform addresses the problem of trust and transparency in charitable donations, ensuring funds are used as intended and donors can see where they are applicated.

**Tech Stack:**
  * Blockchain Platform: Solana
  * Smart Contract Development: Rust / Anchor
  * Metaplex Core: For assets creation and maintenance, On-chain asset attributes.
